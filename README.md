# Project 3 - Airline Delay
Shows delay statistics 
## Problem StatementÂ 
The data was originally hosted on Kaggle and was purposed for projecting whether a given flight will be delayed  when given information about scheduled departure. For the purpose of this project, it will just be used to write a story about flight delay experience across the listed airports.
The Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time.
